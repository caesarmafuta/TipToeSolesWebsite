# TipToe Soles Website â€“ Cert IV Web Assessment

This site was created as part of a Cert IV Web Design module.  
I wrote all code myself using the assessment brief and class requirements.

To check syntax and improve accessibility, I used:
- W3C Validator
- GitHub, Visual Studio Code
- GPT (for debugging advice, syntax review, and guidance on layout best practices)

No automated web builder or pre-made template was used.
